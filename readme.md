# Learning DirectX 11 with Windows 8.1 SDK 8.1

My journey through the book, [Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 11 by Frank D. Luna](http://www.d3dcoder.net/d3d11.htm).

The book implements the examples against the older [June 2010 DirectX SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=6812).  Instead, I am implementing against the [Windows 8.1 SDK](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=253588) installed as part of [Visual Studio 2013](https://www.visualstudio.com/).
